●	Public Actions: Sentiment analysis also is used to monitor and analyse social phenomena, for the spotting of potentially dangerous situations and determining the general mood of the blogosphere.

In this project, we address the problem of sentiment classification on twitter dataset. We use a number of text preprocessing and Naive Bayes classifier methods to perform sentiment analysis. In the end, we use a accuracy classifying method of different text preprocessing to achieve the classification accuracy of 76.78% on Kaggle public leaderboard.
